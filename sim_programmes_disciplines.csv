The FastTrack program fully incorporates students into senior Alberta MBA elective courses.\nThere are numerous benefits associated with earning an MBA in combination with already holding a Business degree. Business grads are eligible to complete a reduced course load, meaning not only will the length of their Master＊s degree be shortened but tuition costs will also be reduced. In addition, upon graduation from the MBA program, students will likely be eligible for a higher salary and/or promotion at their existing organizations. MBA grads are also prone to take on more managerial and leadership positions while also having the ability to accelerate their career path. This is due to the dedicated career support and one-on-one career coaching made available to MBA students. And finally, the MBA program will increase and diversify both students＊ professional and personal network.\nThe MBA (FastTrack) prepares students for senior management positions in today＊s global business environment. The strategic and leadership orientation of the program will help students develop a strategic, analytical, and global approach to business.

When Britain left the European Union, decision efficiency in the EU improved in leaps and bounds.\nThis programme builds on core economic theories and important concepts of modern political thought. It develops your intellectual capacity to understand the world in political and economic terms. Emphasis is on microeconomics, macroeconomics, understanding the state of democracy, and the democratic process. You will learn the rigorous process of conducting economic analysis at micro, macro and international level. In addition, you will be exposed to the debates in comparative politics and their social-economic impact.\nShow more\nShow less","Intake Dates\n2025 Aug intake\nPROGRAMME DURATION\nAug 2025 to Jun 2028 (3 years)\nAPPLICATION PERIOD\nApplications are open till 1 Jun 2025 (Local and Intl).\nEarly submission of application is strongly recommended.\n2025 Sep intake\nPROGRAMME DURATION\nSep 2025 to Jun 2028 (3 years)\nAPPLICATION PERIOD\nApplications are open till 1 Jun 2025 (Local and Intl).\nEarly submission of application is strongly recommended.\nMinimum / Maximum Candidature Period\nStandard BSc (Hons) (12 modules) 3 years / 6 years\nGraduate BSc (Hons) (9 modules) 3 years / 6 years\n*The candidature period may be extended by the University on a case-by-case basis.\nNo refund or recourse should student fail to complete within the maximum period.\nAt SIM, students who are academically weak and find it difficult to progress or complete the programme within the minimum duration will receive counselling.\nSIM reserves the right to recommend and withdraw a student who cannot cope with the demands of the programme, especially when the student＊s pass has expired.","Modules\nStandard Entry Route\n100 modules\n1. #EC1002 Introduction to economics\n2.
