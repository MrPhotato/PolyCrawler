    "introduction": "Rather than relearning business fundamentals, the FastTrack MBA focuses your studies on advanced management topics that you require to take your career to the next level. The FastTrack program fully incorporates students into senior Alberta MBA elective courses. There are numerous benefits associated with earning an MBA in combination with already holding a Business degree. Business grads are eligible to complete a reduced course load, meaning not only will the length of their Master’s degree be shortened but tuition costs will also be reduced. In addition, upon graduation from the MBA program, students will likely be eligible for a higher salary and/or promotion at their existing organizations. MBA grads are also prone to take on more managerial and leadership positions while also having the ability to accelerate their career path. This is due to the dedicated career support and one-on-one career coaching made available to MBA students. And finally, the MBA program will increase and diversify both students’ professional and personal network. The MBA (FastTrack) prepares students for senior management positions in today’s global business environment. The strategic and leadership orientation of the program will help students develop a strategic, analytical, and global approach to business. This skill set is required and compatible with the needs of many industries in their senior leadership.",

As the world becomes ever more data-driven, analytical skills are in high demand but very short in supply. Few companies are exploiting quantitative techniques to their full potential, often due to a lack of in-house expertise. The programme aims to develop competence in students in the application of statistical and machine learning techniques at a high level. It will provide students with a sound knowledge of the principles underlying standard applications of probability and statistics. They will be taught to demonstrate statistical software to analyse datasets and interpret the output, using a variety of algorithmic and model-based methods. It is important for graduates to learn to draw appropriate conclusions following empirical analysis and form the basis for managerial decision-making.",

They are used in digital assistants that respond to our voices, self-driving cars and adaptive education systems. \n\nMachine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets. \n\nWe want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. \nSIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island",

Extracting information out of data using adaptive computer systems. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are starting to play far bigger roles in our daily lives. They are used in digital assistants that respond to our voices, self-driving cars and adaptive education systems. Machine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets. We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island",

    "introduction": "Awarded by University of London, UK and Developed by federation member, Goldsmiths, University of London, UK. Machine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets. We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. Students will learn programming languages such as JavaScript, C++, Node.js and Python among many others. SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island.",

As the world becomes ever more data-driven, analytical skills are in high demand but very short in supply. Few companies are exploiting quantitative techniques to their full potential, often due to a lack of in-house expertise. The programme aims to develop competence in students in the application of statistical and machine learning techniques at a high level. It will provide students with a sound knowledge of the principles underlying standard applications of probability and statistics. They will be taught to demonstrate statistical software to analyse datasets and interpret the output, using a variety of algorithmic and model-based methods. It is important for graduates to learn to draw appropriate conclusions following empirical analysis and form the basis for managerial decision-making.",

Mobile application development in the software industry With the global mobile app market booming and expected to be worth $139 billion by 2021, it is no surprise that it is common for established organisations to have a web presence which includes complex interacting systems. Mobile development is a critical application area for computer science. Many of the largest technology companies maintain large scale web applications, providing services such as social media, search, advertising and video and audio streaming. Mobile application development has become a major part of the software industry over the last decade, with established as well as new companies developing thousands of mobile games and utilities. We want you to learn by doing – we've got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island",

    "introduction": "Awarded by the University of London, UK and Developed by federation member, Goldsmiths, University of London, UK. Extracting information out of data using adaptive computer systems. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are starting to play far bigger roles in our daily lives. They are used in digital assistants that respond to our voices, self-driving cars and adaptive education systems. Machine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets. We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island.",

Extracting information out of data using adaptive computer systems. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are starting to play far bigger roles in our daily lives. They are used in digital assistants that respond to our voices, self-driving cars and adaptive education systems. Machine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets.

Development of web and mobile technology Web and mobile development are critical application areas for computer science. Many of the largest technology companies maintain large scale web applications, providing services such as social media, search, advertising and video and audio streaming. Mobile application development has become a major part of the software industry over the last decade, with established as well as new companies developing thousands of mobile games and utilities. We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. Students will learn programming languages such as JavaScript, C++, Node.js and Python among many others. SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island. Selected local polytechnic diplomas and SIM IT diploma graduates stand to gain exemptions for up to one year. Transfer to the London campus at Goldsmiths after one or two years at SIM.",

Physical computing involves the creation of hardware devices that can sense and act in the real world. Physical computing techniques underpin a wide range of contemporary technology trends such as the Internet of Things, the quantified self and smart homes. There are many applications of physical computing, for example in creative arts, museums, ubiquitous and embedded computing, scientific sensing, robotics, engineering control systems and robotics. We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. Students will learn programming languages such as JavaScript, C++, Node.js and Python among many others. SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993.

    "introduction": "Awarded by the University of London, UK and Developed by federation member, Goldsmiths, University of London, UK. \n\n**Designing computer systems for use by people**\nOur daily lives involve complex tasks, requiring interaction with a plethora of computer systems. User experience design is a critical part of the development of these systems. These advancements ensure the interaction between the individual, computer system and the workflow it enables are all fit for purpose.   \n\nUser experience design or UX has grown out of the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), which is about how to design computer systems for use by people. HCI is a major subfield of computer science, and it has informed the visual design and workflow of computer systems we use every day. HCI draws on a range of hard and soft skills and is a naturally cross-disciplinary subject. \nWe want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. Students will learn programming languages such as JavaScript, C++, Node.js and Python among many others.\nSIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island.",

    "introduction": "Awarded by the University of London, UK and Developed by federation member, Goldsmiths, University of London, UK. Designing computer systems for use by people. Our daily lives involve complex tasks, requiring interaction with a plethora of computer systems. User experience design is a critical part of the development of these systems. These advancements ensure the interaction between the individual, computer system and the workflow it enables are all fit for purpose. User experience design or UX has grown out of the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), which is about how to design computer systems for use by people. HCI is a major subfield of computer science, and it has informed the visual design and workflow of computer systems we use every day. HCI draws on a range of hard and soft skills and is a naturally cross-disciplinary subject. We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island",

With the global mobile app market booming and expected to be worth $139 billion by 2021, it is no surprise that it is common for established organisations to have a web presence which includes complex interacting systems. Web development is a critical application area for computer science. Many of the largest technology companies maintain large scale web applications, providing services such as social media, search, advertising and video and audio streaming. We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island",

Machine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets. We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1. Students will learn programming languages such as JavaScript, C++, Node.js and Python among many others. SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island.",
