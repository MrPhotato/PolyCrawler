Strong foundation in economics and?politics
The world is flat and we’re all backyard neighbours, whether we’re in Beijing or Brooklyn or Bedok. When economic growth was climbing in China, property prices in Singapore went up. When the US presidential election is around the corner, criticisms on China surge. When Britain left the European Union, decision efficiency in the EU improved in leaps and bounds.
This programme builds on core economic theories and important concepts of modern political thought. It develops your intellectual capacity to understand the world in political and economic terms. Emphasis is on microeconomics, macroeconomics, understanding the state of democracy, and the democratic process. You will learn the rigorous process of conducting economic analysis at micro, macro and international level. In addition, you will be exposed to the debates in comparative politics and their social-economic impact.

Rather than relearning business fundamentals, the FastTrack MBA focuses your studies on advanced management topics that you require to take your career to the next level. The FastTrack program fully incorporates students into senior Alberta MBA elective courses.
There are numerous benefits associated with earning an MBA in combination with already holding a Business degree. Business grads are eligible to complete a reduced course load, meaning not only will the length of their Master’s degree be shortened but tuition costs will also be reduced. In addition, upon graduation from the MBA program, students will likely be eligible for a higher salary and/or promotion at their existing organizations. MBA grads are also prone to take on more managerial and leadership positions while also having the ability to accelerate their career path. This is due to the dedicated career support and one-on-one career coaching made available to MBA students. And finally, the MBA program will increase and diversify both students’ professional and personal network.
The MBA (FastTrack) prepares students for senior management positions in today’s global business environment. The strategic and leadership orientation of the program will help students develop a strategic, analytical, and global approach to business. This skill set is required and compatible with the needs of many industries in their senior leadership.

As the world becomes ever more data-driven, analytical skills are in high demand but very short in supply. Few companies are exploiting quantitative techniques to their full potential, often due to a lack of in-house expertise.
The programme aims to develop competence in students in the application of statistical and machine learning techniques at a high level. It will provide students with a sound knowledge of the principles underlying standard applications of probability and statistics.
They will be taught to demonstrate statistical software to analyse datasets and interpret the output, using a variety of algorithmic and model-based methods. It is important for graduates to learn to draw appropriate conclusions following empirical analysis and form the basis for managerial decision-making.

The world is flat and we’re all backyard neighbours, whether we’re in Beijing or Brooklyn or Bedok. When economic growth was climbing in China, property prices in Singapore went up. When the US presidential election is around the corner, criticisms on China surge. When Britain left the European Union, decision efficiency in the EU improved in leaps and bounds.
This programme builds on core economic theories and important concepts of modern political thought. It develops your intellectual capacity to understand the world in political and economic terms. Emphasis is on microeconomics, macroeconomics, understanding the state of democracy, and the democratic process. You will learn the rigorous process of conducting economic analysis at micro, macro and international level. In addition, you will be exposed to the debates in comparative politics and their social-economic impact.

Extracting information out of data using adaptive computer systems
Machine learning and artificial intelligence are starting to play far bigger roles in our daily lives. They are used in digital assistants that respond to our voices, self-driving cars and adaptive education systems.
Machine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets.
We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1.

Many experts highlight the potential for Financial Technology (FinTech) to make finance more accessible for those most in need and the FinTech sector in emerging markets and developing economies saw particularly strong growth – as much as 40% in the Middle East and North Africa. Globally, finance apps alone were downloaded more than four billion times in 2020.
This has disrupted the banking and finance industry too – from international banks to back-room start-ups - and changed the way we handle money.
This innovative programme will provide graduates with in-demand quantitative and analytical skills necessary to embark on a successful career in FinTech or in the financial services sector.
The programme combines technology from big data and analytics, mobile computing and modern financial services, to enable better decision-making for organisations.
The required modules will allow the student to gain a strong foundation of knowledge, as well as practical experience and the opportunity to tailor learning to meet individual career ambitions.

Many experts highlight the potential for Financial Technology (FinTech) to make finance more accessible for those most in need and the FinTech sector in emerging markets and developing economies saw particularly strong growth – as much as 40% in the Middle East and North Africa. Globally, finance apps alone were downloaded more than four billion times in 2020.
This has disrupted the banking and finance industry too – from international banks to back-room start-ups – and changed the way we handle money.
This innovative programme will provide graduates with in-demand quantitative and analytical skills necessary to embark on a successful career in FinTech or in the financial services sector.
The programme?combines technology from big data and analytics, mobile computing and modern financial services, to enable better decision-making for organisations.
The required modules and an applied project will allow the student to gain a strong foundation of knowledge, as well as practical experience and the opportunity to tailor learning to meet individual career ambitions.

As the world becomes ever more data-driven, analytical skills are in high demand but very short in supply. Few companies are exploiting quantitative techniques to their full potential, often due to a lack of in-house expertise.
The programme aims to develop competence in students in the application of statistical and machine learning techniques at a high level. It will provide students with a sound knowledge of the principles underlying standard applications of probability and statistics.
They will be taught to demonstrate statistical software to analyse datasets and interpret the output, using a variety of algorithmic and model-based methods. It is important for graduates to learn to draw appropriate conclusions following empirical analysis and form the basis for managerial decision-making.
Prerequisite(s)
This statistics degree programme requires candidates to have attained greater competency in mathematics prior to admission.

Mobile application development in the software industry
With the global mobile app market booming and expected to be worth $139 billion by 2021, it is no surprise that it is common?for established organisations to have a web presence which includes complex interacting systems.
Mobile development is a critical application area for computer science. Many of the largest technology companies maintain large scale web applications, providing services such as social media, search, advertising and video and audio streaming. Mobile application development has become a major part of the software industry over the last decade, with established as well as new companies developing thousands of mobile games and utilities.
We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1.
SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island

Extracting information out of data using adaptive computer systems
Machine learning and artificial intelligence are starting to play far bigger roles in our daily lives. They are used in digital assistants that respond to our voices, self-driving cars and adaptive education systems.
Machine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets.
We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1.

Mobile application development in the software industry
With the global mobile app market booming and expected to be worth $139 billion by 2021, it is no surprise that it is common for established organisations to have a web presence which includes complex interacting systems.
Mobile development is a critical application area for computer science. Many of the largest technology companies maintain large scale web applications, providing services such as social media, search, advertising and video and audio streaming. Mobile application development has become a major part of the software industry over the last decade, with established as well as new companies developing thousands of mobile games and utilities.
We want you to learn by doing – we’ve got a strong focus on the practical rather than the theoretical. The program is highly hands-on; you will be designing, developing and implementing software solutions since Day 1.
SIM and the Goldsmiths Department of Computing have collaborated to offer computing programmes locally since 1993. The new programmes, which focus on AI, Web Services and other rapidly rising technologies, will propel Singapore to achieve its dreams of becoming a smart nation and intelligent island

Designing computer systems for use by people
Our daily lives involve complex tasks, requiring interaction with a plethora of computer systems. User experience design is a critical part of the development of these systems. These advancements ensure the interaction between the individual, computer system and the workflow it enables are all fit for purpose.
User experience design or UX has grown out of the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), which is about how to design computer systems for use by people. HCI is a major subfield of computer science, and it has informed the visual design and workflow of computer systems we use every day. HCI draws on a range of hard and soft skills and is a naturally cross-disciplinary subject.

Extracting information out of data using adaptive computer systems
Machine learning and artificial intelligence are starting to play far bigger roles in our daily lives. They are used in digital assistants that respond to our voices, self-driving cars and adaptive education systems.
Machine learning provides a means for computer systems to extract useful information out of data. These techniques are widely used in the technology industry for a variety of applications, for example, recommending music and other products to people, identifying faces in photos and predicting trends in financial markets.
